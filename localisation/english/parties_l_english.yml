##Sub-ideology
##Revolutionism ## 
 Authoritarianism_revolutionism:0 "Authoritarian Revolutionism"
 Authoritarianism_revolutionism_desc:0 "Authoritarian revolutionism is a revolutionary ideology that advocates the leadership of a particular class or group of people and the distribution of power and governance by such a group. Typically, authoritarian revolutionism occurs in countries or regions where the conditions for revolution are not yet ripe, but where revolution is forced by history. Such revolutions have not yet been able to develop a revolutionary program in line with the status quo. Therefore, in order to safeguard the tender fruits of the revolution from the reactionary counter-attacks, it is necessary to clean up and sanction all the forces that hinder the revolution by means of dictatorship. Thus, dictatorial revolutionism is not so much an ideology as a necessary means to protect the revolution. Nevertheless, for various reasons, such as not having received sufficient theoretical guidance and revolutionary education, there are some people who believe that the revolution will not be accomplished overnight, but that the state of dictatorial revolution will be maintained for a long period of time. In this case, if a theory of revolutionism that is appropriate to the actual situation cannot be developed in due course, there is a risk that dictatorial revolutionism will slide into the opposite direction of revolution."

 nationalism_revolutionism:0 "national revolutionaryism"
 nationalism_revolutionism_desc:0 "Nationalist revolutionism is a revolutionary ideology with a distinctly national flavor; such revolutionaries tend to advocate revolutions only in their own nation or in nations and regions that are led and dominated by their own nation, and often do not intend to extend the revolution to other nations and nationalities, and may even deliberately establish divisions between different nationalities and status gaps."

 Socialism_revolutionism:0 "Revolutionary socialism"
 socialism_revolutionism_desc:0 "Revolutionary socialism advocates a revolution to promote a change in the power of the state, and through that change to improve the social environment and promote the public good. Such revolutionaries often lacked a vision of the longer term future and wished only to use the power of revolution to carry out 'improvements' to the state and society, and so they also had difficulty in coming up with a groundbreaking program to guide the country's social development."


 Scientism_revolutionism:0 "scientific socialism"
 Scientism_revolutionism_desc:0 "Scientific socialism advocates the establishment of a socialist society in the true sense of the word, and a transition to a higher form of society, by means of rational, reliable and locally adapted methods. Such revolutionaries tend to be educated people who have studied the theories of Marx and Engels# and usually have different perceptions of the direction of development of the countries and regions to which they belong, but usually advocate the reorganization of the situation of the state and society in the form of a revolution that is as rational as possible."


 Leninism_revolutionism:0 "Leninism"
 Leninism_revolutionism_desc:0 "Leninism, also known as Marxism-Leninism, is an ideology that inherits and develops the ideas of Marx and Engels about class society, and, based on how Leninists have articulated this ideology, Leninism can be viewed as the Marxism of the age of imperialism and proletarian revolution. According to Marxism-Leninism, "all the history of human society is the history of class struggle." The overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat can only be achieved through a form of violent revolution. On the question of the leadership of the revolution, the Leninists argued that while the Paris Commune-style committee system had its merits, the present state of the revolution in Russia did not allow it to realize large-scale committee democracy at the outset of the revolution. Therefore as the basis of the revolution, a socialist party needs to be formed and made the nucleus of the revolution, mobilizing the broadest proletarian masses for the proletarian revolution."

 Commissionism_revolutionism:0 "Commissionism"
 Commissionism_revolutionism_desc:0 "Commissionism usually refers to an ideology that follows the doctrines of Marx and Engels on the class struggle and hopes to bring about a socialist revolution through the spontaneous organization and struggle of the workers to overthrow the feudal and bourgeois classes. According to the committeeists, the revolutionary organization does not play a leading role in the process of revolution, but rather propaganda and agitation within the class, thus stimulating the consciousness of the working class to struggle, and the struggle is carried out through the workers' committees, which are the direct organs of democracy under the control of the working class. Consequently, committeeism was quite repulsed by the idea of a revolutionary party seizing power, believing that such a move would lead to the dictatorship of the party. Because of its radical democrat and revolutionist views, Comitism diverged from its fellow Leninists on the leadership of the revolution, and from the reformists on their approach to the revolutionary question. Their views were closer to syndicalism and even anarchism. The syndicalists believe that the workers' sense of autonomous struggle must be stimulated, and that struggle and construction must be carried out through democratic workers' committees in order to overthrow capitalism, turn away from bureaucracy, and thus realize the long-cherished dream of Marx and Engels."

 Agrarianism_revolutionism:0 "agrarian socialism"
 Agrarianism_revolutionism_desc:0 "Modern capitalism and industry have given birth to the proletariat and brought it to the stage of history. But beyond the thriving cities lie the vast fields and the laborers who for thousands of years have fed all mankind, the peasants. Therefore, when the winds of revolution were blowing in those ancient countries that had not yet entered the industrial world, agrarian socialism produced the fruits of the new world in the ancient soil. Agrarian socialism, as its name suggests, was popular in countries where industrialization had not yet been completed and where agricultural production was still dominant. In these countries, the urban proletariat is often not strong enough to carry out a proletarian revolution on its own, and must therefore organically combine with the masses of workers in the countryside in order to carry out a revolution in the interests of the broadest possible masses of the people to defeat the big bourgeoisie and the feudal landlords and to completely change the system of private ownership of land, which has brought about so much misery in the past. Despite the word "agriculture". and rooted in the land. But agrarian socialists were not Luddites who wanted to regress to a primitive civilization. On the contrary, they understand how modern industry has revolutionized agriculture, a profession that has been practiced by mankind for thousands of years. Therefore, agrarian socialists do not reject industrialization; on the contrary, they encourage the fruits of industrialization to be tilted toward agricultural resources. After all, a hoe swung smoking can't be faster than a tractor."
