 BRA_jie_shao: "The Brazilian Empire of the 20th century could not be called a "country" at all. The division of Brazilian society at all levels made people nostalgic for the brilliant late Emperor Pedro II, who united society and led the modernization of the country, and who, to put it politely, Isabel Luiza, the current Empress Luiza, screwed everything up. -It was she who freed the Brazilian slaves, but it was also she who tore the empire apart, the great Golden Rule was perfect, but it never made it down to the countryside, and the centralization that Pedro II had advocated for was destroyed, the power given to the localities ended up letting the slave owners live, and divided the center of the empire, with the empress as the last string holding it together, and threatening to collapse at any moment. The empress became the last string holding the center together, and it could snap at any time. \n\n§R "Slavery is dead, we shall be free at last"\! \n\nIn May 1888, on the day the Golden Act was to be enacted, crowds in Rio de Janeiro spontaneously marched through the streets, carrying Pedro's portrait and the flag of the Brazilian empire in celebration of a day when the monarchy had never been more supported or more fragile. If only everything had been as beautiful as that day, but unfortunately the "saint" Pedro was not there to witness it, as he had actually died in Portugal a month earlier, leaving behind only one last message of blessing for Brazil: "May God grant me my last hope: to give Brazil peace and prosperity. " Yet this is where all the tragedy began. \n\nIn fact the news of Pedro II's death, which changed everything, was at first known only to the royal family, which was in direct contact with the emperor, and unfortunately the majority of the entire central government was kept in the dark by the fact that the members of the Assembly, the Ministers of War and the Navy were composed almost exclusively of commoners. However, the large slave-owners, composed mainly of aristocrats, were almost the first to receive this information, and a strong sense of crisis was born in the collective of the slave-owners, who had been restrained for many years by a series of legislations of the "Abolitionist League", to influence the Conservative Party in legislating for the reorganization of the Imperial National Guard, and to pay a tribute to the heroes of the Paraguayan war, the loyal monarchs, the Field Marshal of Manuel, and the Emperor. tist, Field Marshal Manuel Luis Osorio, threw an olive branch. The results speak for themselves, and a month later, under the leadership of Field Marshal Manuel, the National Guard, which had just completed its training, stormed the palace in Rio de Janeiro and coerced the regent at the time, Isabel Luisa, to formally ascend to the throne as emperor, known as Isabel II, and telegraphed to the nation that Pedro II was dead, that the empire was in danger of toppling over, and that it must be succeeded immediately, and that the government was in a state of emergency. \n\n§G "The republicans will be wretches who, having fought foreign enemies with wars and weapons, will then use them for despotism, persecution and violence against their own countrymen." §! \n\nHowever, the Conservative Party, which was in league with the slaveholders, did not want to stop there; slavery could never be abolished today, and after mobilizing the monarchists at home and reaching out to the United States, the Gold Act was "indefinitely suspended" in June 1888, which provoked a wave of discontent among a section of the masses, but it was quickly quelled. The Assembly was dissolved, and on the following day elections were held, in which the votes of the Brazilian monarchists and the bullets of the National Guard expelled the republicans from the Liberal Party, while the leader of the Liberal Party, Viscount Ouro Preto, took the bull by the horns, and the democratic idea of legislating for greater local autonomy was adopted. But not everyone was satisfied with this, even if the republican officers in the army were purged, a large number of underclassmen who had enlisted as slaves in exchange for their freedom did not look kindly on the slavers, and the army was loyal only to the emperor, who was the actual last supporter of the empress. Although the Empire claimed that "slavery has mostly disappeared", the disappearance was limited to the major cities and towns connected by roads and railroads, and thanks to the Liberal Democrats' proposal, the autonomy of the Empire's provinces was expanded to an unprecedented degree, and slavery still existed in the poorly educated and almost isolated villages, where the law was considered to be a waste of paper. \It wasn't that the central government didn't want to take care of it, but because of the quality of the loans given to the large plantation owners over time, and the large amount of plants these plantation owners supplied to the government every year, most of which was coffee enough to be exchanged for large amounts of foreign currency, the central government could only close its eyes and pretend it didn't have it. But in the long run, it has caused an extremely serious consequence, that is, the irreversible fragmentation of the Brazilian society, this is a slave owners, factory owners, slaves, workers, peasants coexist in the strange society, and in the highly autonomous provinces, either all kinds of status of the people to maintain only a very small amount of contact, resulting in the production of social production of the efficiency of the strange low, this is not good, the worst place of the various classes of people in the contradiction, some places simply simply paralyzed, and in some places, it's not good. places are simply paralyzed outright, unable to string together as a whole at all. \n\nThe progress of industrialization into the 20th century also completely stagnated, the shackles of slavery tied the empire's progress, the price is the treatment of workers worse and worse, the factory owners in parliament complained more and more loudly, the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party tit for tat while the Queen can only look on from the sidelines. There were also dissenting voices in the army, with the representative of the "lieutenants' wing" of the Brazilian army, Congressman Getúlio Vargas, advocating the sweeping away of the "remnants of the old days" that still existed in the country, the return of all power to the center, and the introduction of a new "socialization" policy. The reorganization of the Brazilian National Guard, which was to become the National Guard of Brazil, was to bring Brazilian society back together again through complete industrialization. The reorganized Brazilian National Guard supported the Crown Prince Pedro de Alcántara, hoping that his successor would inherit his grandfather's talent and reorganize the empire, and the "Royal Delegation" set up by Pedro II became the Crown Prince's small court, the third force in the Imperial Assembly. The Empire is on the brink of civil war, and the victory of Dixie in North America does not seem to be a good omen, but we believe that the courageous and kind-hearted Brazilians will finally be free \n\n§Y "Brazil is bound to regain peace and prosperity"\n\n§Y! \n\nI am from Narnia\n\nI have been called a "lamb", but I am not a lamb\n\nI prefer to remain silent than to open my mouth and say no\n\nMy silence is a prayer\n\nMy God\n\n\nVibrates with the strength that sustains me in my life\n\n\n\nAll that I ask for now is quietness and attention\n\nMe! want to tell of the suffering I went through for no reason\n\nMy regrets were born in slavery\n\nIt was an experience I was forced to go through\n\nI went through humiliation and agony\n\nBut I won, and I carry Narnia in my heart."



 NPL_jie_shao: "Country Profile \n\nSince the crown of France fell in 1871, almost half a century ago, the young Fourth in Africa's journey also could not escape the erosion of the years, along with his small court, which ultimately triggered the wars of independence of the three countries in North Africa, and the so-called imperial government in Algiers could not even come up with any effective suppression program. The last vestige of the "French Empire", an exiled and decadent pseudo-regime, was torn off by the Muslims of North Africa. \The old, but still healthy Napoleon IV did not lose his head, he realized that this was just a small episode in the "War of the Robbers", and that the legless hunter would need more planning and better timing to hunt, and that he needed to be patient and wait for...\n\n the ancient Sultanate of Morocco. The country was already dead in its graves...but the inhabitants of the land had taken upon themselves the responsibility and duty of fighting oppression, as the great Maghreb historian Ibn Khaldun had said. The young, wise Abd al-Krim was on the cusp of the Muslims of North Africa and even half of Europe, and word of his legendary defeats of Spanish and French colonial armies with fewer and fewer troops spread almost all over the Mediterranean, and more and more Moroccans, colonial armies, and Muslims of North Africa came to join him until the "Republic of the Rif" came into being. " came out of nowhere. \n\n1920 North Africa would be dominated by the Rif Republic's tussle with the French Empire. Bonaparte's side will set out to recover North Africa, with landing death squads from Napoli in Europe and an expeditionary force from the Egyptian Empire in the East laying out the final executions for the colonial rebels. On the side of the Republic of the Rif, a new European colonial army was to be prepared, and Abd al-Krim was to write a "Letter to the Muslims of North Africa" in pursuit of the unity of all the Muslims of the Maghreb, the "land of the sunsets". \n\n§Y "Once I was so old, but now I am in my prime."\§!"



 FRA_jie_shao: "The nation introduces \n§R Rise up, the starving slaves \n\n rise up, the suffering people of the world! \n\nFull blood has boiled \n\nto fight for the truth! \n\n§! As the "Internationale" plays over Paris and red flags hang from street lamps on buildings across France, the dream of Eugène Baudier, the remarkable leader involved in the Paris Commune 50 years ago, has been realized today. \n Since the Industrial Revolution, the polarization of French society between the rich and the poor has been increasing, coupled with the siege of Paris by the Prussian army, with constant shelling and food shortages, the poor have become poorer and poorer, and the whole city has been thrown into agitation. As the Prussian army continued to shell Paris, the living conditions of the people in the city worsened. All these greatly intensified the discontent of all sectors of society. The citizens of Paris, especially the working class and the lower middle class, hoped for a democratic republic, and in January 1871, a huge red poster was put up saying "Make way for the Commune, the people of Paris have the right to defend themselves and to create a better world". At the same time, a citizen's army called the "French National Self-Defense Army" took up arms and led all the working class. This self-defense force grew rapidly, forming 194 battalions with 300,000 men in just one month, and later became an important force in the Commune, which was founded in Paris and began to build its own ideal society. They issued the "Letter to the People of France" and put forward their ruling program, emphasizing "the continuous participation of the citizens in the affairs of the Commune, the free expression of their opinions, and the defense of their rights and interests", and transforming from "for the people" to "by the people". by the people". As Marx said, "The Commune, with its measures of prudence and moderation, has shown the direction of development of a system of government by the people, realized by the people themselves." France today has become the first line of defense of socialism on the European continent, and every year socialists from other countries come to learn from it, a monument to socialism and to the people. Long live the \n\n§R Commune! §! \n\n§R (Vive la commune)§!"
