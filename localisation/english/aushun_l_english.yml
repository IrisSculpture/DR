They have their sights on Bosnia, and Transleitania wants us to annex Bosnia to them, but from a national point of view, Illyria is undoubtedly more deserving of this region than Transleitania. If we support Transletania, this will unsettle Illyria, and indeed all the Slavs in the Empire..."

Budapest had disarmed the imperial garrison and was marching on Sarajevo. The march will not stop until our demands are met. Our basic demands are: 1. Compensate the Hungarian Slovak people for their losses over the years and transfer Bosnia to the Transletania government. 2. Completely cancel the privileges of Neletania nobles in Transleitania and allow Transleitania to formulate its own regional constitution. 3. Recognize the customs autonomy of Transleitania. 4. Imperial troops are not allowed to enter areas under the jurisdiction of the Transleitania Council without authorization from the Transleitania Council."

 aushun.8.d: "The Budapest Assembly declared that the emperor had completely lost the support of the people in Transletania because of his refusal to accept "numerous sincere requests from the Magyars and Slovaks." At the request of the people, Transletania seceded from the Austrian Empire with immediate effect and established the government of the Hungarian Provisional Republic. The newly established republican government announced that it would restore the "homeland under Bosnian control" and establish a complete and free Hungarian state. The Hungarian army and the Illyrian army have begun to exchange fire. The suburbs of Zagreb are under fire. Vienna has not yet expressed its position."
