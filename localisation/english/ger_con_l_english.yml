 sax_problem.1.d: "With the collective economic downturn of the German Confederation in recent years, the countries that were unwilling to be led by the Austrian Emperor resumed their attempts to integrate the German nation fifty years ago, when Wilhelm II was still "Little William". \nThe prelude to a great symphony belonging to the German nation sounded in Saxony.\nThe dispute over foreign policy within the Government of the Principality of Saxony evolved into an open armed conflict. Pro-Prussian political forces announced the establishment of a new government in Dresden with the support of the Prussian army, and the King of Saxony evacuated to Weimar to form a new government. The Provisional Government, I guess the Austrian Emperor will be shocked."
 sax_problem.1.a: "Germany stands on the edge of a cliff, but the ending will never be an abyss."
 sax_war_has_boom: "The Saxon War has not yet broken out"
 sax_problem.2.t: "Prussian-backed army wins Saxon War"
 sax_problem.2.d: "As expected, no one could win Prussia's defeat on the battlefield, not even the Prussian-backed armies, and no one had the power to prevent the unification of the German nation."
 sax_problem.2.a: "Saxony will be united with Prussia, and the prelude has already been played."
 sax_problem.3.t: "The Saxon government won the Saxon War"
 sax_problem.3.d: "What is incredible is that the militia troops and even strong men temporarily recruited by the Saxon government, which was originally relocated temporarily, defeated the army supported by Prussia. This is simply a military miracle, enough to be recorded in the annals of German history, but for Prussia, this is a disaster. The angry and red face of "Red-faced William" must be impressive."

 sax_problem.5.a: "One failure cannot stop the process of German reunification"
 sax_problem.5.b: "Maybe we overestimated Prussia"
 sax_problem.6.t: "Instigate a coup in Saxony"
 sax_problem.6.d: "Although Saxony belongs to North Germany with us, Saxony has always been closer to Austria. The first step in uniting Germany is to bring Saxony under our control.

 ger_con.3.d: "The struggle between Prussia and Austria for leadership of the German Confederation turned into a war, and Germany split into two camps. A small-scale military conflict has broken out between Austria and Prussia in Silesia, and it seems only a matter of time before the entire German Confederation falls into a full-scale war.

 ger_aus_uni_aus: "Our army moved unimpeded, and Berlin changed hands. The Hohenzollerns have surrendered and their rebellions have been wiped out. Praise be to our Emperor.\nAlthough the post-war reconstruction work is a headache, and the handling of the rebels is also a sinkhole for all parties to argue with, His Majesty the Emperor believes that the rebels have been reduced to nothing and everything will be fine."
 ger_aus_uni_oth: "Recently, according to the Austrian Empire's "Kronen Zeitung" (Crown Newspaper), the Austrian coalition won the war. This exceeded everyone's expectations. The decadent and weak Commonwealth actually defeated the military nation made of blood and iron. This is definitely a military miracle worthy of being recorded in history. The world was once again shocked by the "Universal Empire", Habsburg The name of the castle once again resounded throughout the world.\nHowever, the hearts of European countries can finally let go. The enlightened Austrian Emperor will definitely lead the German Confederation into the future with a more moderate and friendly attitude. The French Ambassador to Austria quoted the "Basel" written by then President Jean Jaures. Declaration as a gift to celebrate peace between the two countries, and Great Britain announced the end of diplomatic isolation from the German Confederation in anticipation of future cooperation."

If the Habsburgs still want to resist, then we will fight until complete victory.\nAn empire that truly belongs to Germany declared itself to the world in Vienna. Every German is proud of, bleeds for, and sheds tears for the enthronement ceremony here and now. \nThe black hawks circled above us, and we were history."
 ger_pre_uni_oth: "Recently, the Prussian State Radio reported that the Prussian army had captured Vienna and was "discussing" with the Austrian Emperor about ending the war. People announced the arrival of a new era in the excited and trembling voice of the broadcaster.\nBut this is as expected. Generally speaking, Prussia's iron heel is unstoppable, let alone Austria. As German nationalists claim, the reunification of the German motherland is unstoppable.\nBut for European countries, this is tantamount to a horror story coming into reality. The then British Prime Minister Lloyd George made this discussion:\nNo one here is more reluctant than me. , and are even more disgusted to see the prospect of us being involved in a war... Historically, if a country is involved in a war, it must resort to the noble name of honor. Many crimes are committed in the name of honor. Yes, some of it is happening now. However, after all, national honor is an objective reality, and any country that ignores this reality is doomed to perish."\nNo foreign politician wants to see a unified Germany The Empire, with its terrifying national size, invincible military level, and complete war machine, was able to defeat the Napoleonic Empire at its peak fifty years ago, but by this time they had ended their internal strife. \nWho will they target next?"
