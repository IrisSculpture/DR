 JPN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Since the Meiji Restoration, the comprehensive strength of the Japanese Empire has developed rapidly and it has become a military power in East Asia. The victory of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1898 marked that no force can stop them from establishing hegemony in East Asia. But incomplete political reforms have restricted the country's development, and Crown Prince Yoshihito also hopes to make some changes. In order to consolidate the status of the empire, it must expand outward and compete with Western powers for living space. Every war is a big gamble, and the rulers of the empire know that if they lose even once, the country will fall into an abyss of eternal destruction."

 GATHERING_STORM_NAME: "the turbulent twenties"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "In 1815, just like the endings of the first to fifth anti-French alliances, the seventh anti-French alliance collapsed in Waterloo. Europe finally ushered in a new era of peace. Since then, there have been basically no major conflicts on the European continent. The German states were busy with internal disputes and had no time to pay attention to foreign countries; the Habsburgs were exhausted by the rebellion in their crown territories; the British Empire was paying the price for its long-term interests; and the new French revolutionary regime was also struggling with its big government. In such a strange peace, as the world moves into the 20th century, can peace still be maintained? Or will the new order overthrow everything that exists and turn the entire continent upside down? As of today in 1920, the world seems to have reached a turning point in history."
  
 FRW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "£country_map\nThe French Democratic Federation was the product of the Paris Commune movement in 1871. It changed France far more than any previous regime. Since most countries outside of France were still monarchies, the new republic gained more hostility than ever; even politically, the republic was in danger, with various pan-left parties attacking each other and trying to control the country. The right to speak. In order to stabilize the new political power and face possible foreign enemies, various left-wing parties united to form the "French Democratic Alliance" to maintain unity within the government in the form of a big government - but this unity is not stable, and the wheel of history is changing. Roll forward."
  
 ENL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "£country_map_ENL\nFrom recorded history to the present day, Great Britain remains the only huge empire that spans all continents around the world. Wherever the sun reaches, the glory of the empire shines on every imperial subject. Due to the failure of the Seventh Anti-French Alliance, Britain was forced to change its own policies. With the increasing anti-colonial wave, in order to maintain its huge colonies, the "Imperial Federation Plan" came into being. This bold plan was seen at the time. It was very advanced, but it maintained the colonial empire of Great Britain and temporarily suppressed the dominions outside the British island. But the foundations of the empire have begun to shake. Once the train starts, it will never stop. On the island of Ireland, the Irish unilaterally established an independent Irish Congress; in the South Asian subcontinent, Gandhi is leading India out of our control, and even across the strait , our most difficult enemies are also encouraging the dominions to secede. Britain's light is not infinite, and the Empire on which the sun never sets is not the sun after all, but Britain will not perish, and she will use her own means to make that light last forever."
  
 WWS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "£country_map_WWS\nThe ancient Holy Roman Empire existed in Europe for more than 800 years. It is a loose association of the German nation and a political arena where the princes and nobles of the German states constantly compete for the leadership of Germany. The unification of Germany was hard-won. In 1870, the German army defeated the arrogant French in Sedan and established the German Empire. France immediately fell into civil strife. Now the French want to come back with their new beliefs, and the Swiss government, which has always implemented neutrality, has been overthrown by the communists. It can be said that the west of the empire has fallen into the threat of communism."
  
 TEQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "£country_map_TEQ\nThe empire is almost paralyzed, and the pardon issued in the Rose Garden is just a flash in the pan. The Sultan's orders could not reach Istanbul, the secularization process had almost stalled, and the new army became an army on paper. Opposite Istanbul is Bulgaria, the spokesperson of the Russians in the Balkans. Behind it is Egypt, which is independent from the empire. The most terrible thing is from the Black Sea. The damn Russians have extorted our straits and locked our throats. In short, the building will collapse, and for Sudan, being able to live one day at a time is the best outcome."
  
 AOX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "£country_map_AOX\nThe Austrian-Hungarian Empire was a large country located in Central Europe, but a large country also had its own pains: its complex ethnic composition caused the country to fall into deep internal nationalist conflicts, its economic construction was stagnant, and it was highly dependent on Germany. Imperial support. As the independence movement in each crown territory becomes more and more fierce, the entire empire may fall into complete collapse at any time. A civil war is inevitable..."
  
 SBY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "£country_map_SBY\n"Calm and calm" was synonymous with the Iberian Peninsula in the early 20th century. The first-generation "Empire on which the Sun Never Sets", which once controlled half of the world and whose invincible fleets roamed the world, has now become the edge of Europe. In the hundred years since the Bourbons came under Spanish rule, Spain and even the Iberian Peninsula have almost stagnated: tradition has almost become synonymous with modern Spain - perhaps, there has never been modern Spain, and the current Spain is still the ancient Spain it once was. In the declining Spain, if it weren't for the great plague, no one would know what was new in this ancient kingdom. Will Spain still stay in a corner of Europe, a bystander and stay away from the conflict? Or will he rise up and revive the ancient empire? Or will Spain be unable to mediate its internal disputes, and a new Spain will stand tall in the world? Nothing is impossible in Spain."

 SHW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "£country_map_SHW\nAfter the defeat of Waterloo, the Russian Empire had to sign the Warsaw Agreement with Napoleonic France. From then on, the two countries maintained a non-aggression relationship until the outbreak of the French Democratic Revolution. 1871 was a special year: in order to prevent the democratic revolution from spreading in Europe, Alexander III formed the "League of Three Emperors" to fight against the revolutionary forces. After the Berlin Conference, the Russian army took the lead in establishing colonies in Ethiopia, but the distribution of colonial dividends was very uneven. Most of them flowed into the coffers of the nobles. Most farmers lived in extremely harsh conditions, which indirectly led to the 1917 The outbreak of the February Revolution. The Tsar, with the support of the Kaiser and the Austrian Emperor, suppressed the revolution and had to use Stolypin to carry out constitutional reforms. Constitutional reform has enabled the development of the capitalist economy, but the revolutionary wave that seems to have subsided is still surging. The Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Social Democratic Labor Party have great appeal among farmers and workers. People in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland and other places have The independence movement was also growing."
  
 ITE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "£country_map_ITE\nThe northern region was influenced by the French Democratic Revolution and became the stronghold and iron ticket warehouse of the Democratic Constitutional Party; while the southern region is not very interested in concepts such as "liberty", "equality" and "fraternity", and many people choose Support the Pope and the King. In order to fight against the storm of the democratic revolution, the kingdom chose to stand with the French government-in-exile and the major powers, but whether this cooperation can be maintained has become a question. The Austrian Empire in the east was falling into chaos, and the French government-in-exile struggled to cope with frequent indigenous uprisings. It is unclear how long this revolutionary breakwater will last, and it is difficult to predict how the Risorgimento will evolve in the future."
