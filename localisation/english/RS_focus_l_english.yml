But anyone with a modicum of common sense would realize that the small court in Algiers was crumbling, and the easy independence of the three North African countries also proved its vulnerability. Therefore, the "Algiers Fortress" plan came into being, which is to build large-scale fortifications around important cities and industrial areas in Algiers to face the attack from the Kingdom of Jazaire and the Kingdom of Tunisia. And now it’s time to inspect the goods."
  
 NPL_focus3: "Landing in Tripoli"
 NPL_focus3_desc: "Fortunately, at the "darkest moment when we were abandoned by the world," the Bonaparte brothers extended a helping hand and pulled us back. The Kingdom of Naples promised to be a staunch ally of our country and was willing to hand over combat command and obey our army's combat plan. A crazy landing plan is located in "Tripoli". As the only republic in North Africa, the Republic of Tripolitalia has the relatively most developed economy and even industrial capabilities, so destroying it quickly is the top priority after the sudden outbreak of war, and the most effective way It was a surprise attack on its capital "Tripoli"."
