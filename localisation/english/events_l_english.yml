 WorldNews.1.t: "DR module introduction"
 WorldNews.1.d: "In 1815, just like the endings of the first to fifth anti-French alliances, the seventh anti-French alliance collapsed in Waterloo. Napoleon miraculously led his people to repel the hastily approaching Prussian-Austrian forces, once again consolidating his and his family's status in France. However, the material and spiritual consumption of the war is unquestionable. The French soldiers have no intention of fighting anymore, the French people are exhausted, and the French economy is in dire straits. In order to stabilize the imperial power, Napoleon condescended to conclude an alliance with the anti-French alliance countries in Vienna. The peace treaty "Treaty of Vienna" stipulated that the European continent would maintain the status quo, France would retain its existing territories and vassal states, and Napoleon promised not to invade other countries; the German states jointly formed the German Confederation to balance the power of the European continent, and Europe finally ushered in a new era. era of peace. But peace eventually comes to an end. After Napoleon III succeeded to the throne, he was dissatisfied with the peace policy formulated by his father. Napoleon III hoped to establish a new European order led by France, so he planned an invasion of the German Confederation in 1871. Napoleon III's military ability was no better than that of Napoleon I. Although his invasion was rapid, it was still disintegrated by the united German Allied Forces. The people of France could no longer endure the pain of war, so they launched the Paris Commune Revolution in 1871, overthrew the monarchy, established the French Democratic Federation, and Napoleon III himself went into exile. Since then, there have been basically no major conflicts on the European continent. The German states were busy with internal disputes and had no time to pay attention to foreign countries; the Habsburgs were exhausted by the rebellion in their crown territories; the British Empire was paying the price for its long-term interests; and the new French revolutionary regime was also struggling with its big government. In such a strange peace, as the world moves into the 20th century, can peace still be maintained? Or will the new order overthrow everything that exists and turn the entire continent upside down? As of today in 1920, the world seems to have reached a turning point in history."

The special train passed through places that had not yet been affected by the revolution, which gave the Tsar the illusion that there was room for easing the situation. However, the Duma Provisional Committee had taken control of the Russian railway network and began to track the emperor's train in order to prevent the tsar from returning to the capital. Late at night, the train was intercepted by the revolutionary party at the Little Vishela station, more than 100 kilometers away from the capital. As a last resort, the Tsar train had no choice but to turn around and return. The Tsar's train stopped in Pskov, where the Northern Front headquarters was located. The revolution had not yet spread here, and many people who came to see the Tsar gathered at the train station. When the Tsar appeared in front of the train window, the people took off their hats and saluted, and many farmers knelt down to express their blessings to the Tsar. Completely isolated from the revolutionary tide, the Tsar had no idea that the Soviets and the Provisional Duma Committee had come to dominate Russia's destiny. In fact, when the new regime was established, it pressed the left-leaning shortcut button. In order to consolidate the new regime, the Duma Provisional Committee sent a large number of political commissars to the provinces to replace the imperial governors and bureaucrats. Frontline headquarters, military ports and provincial administrative regions have all turned to the revolution, and a new wave is washing away the dilapidated imperial ship. In the evening, Chief of General Staff Alexeyev sent a telegram stating that the situation in Russia was irreversible and the emperor must abdicate in response to the angry crowd. But the tsar still had illusions about the situation. He hoped to appoint Luo Jiangko as prime minister on the basis of retaining autocracy. Ruzsky told Ludjanko about the Tsar's demands. Luo Jiangke couldn't laugh or cry when he received the telegram. He explained in his reply to Ruzski: "Obviously, neither His Majesty the Emperor nor you know what is happening here. This is the most terrible revolution... in two years For half the time I reminded the emperor in every memorial of mine that if concessions that would satisfy the people of the country were not made immediately, disaster would be imminent... It is with pain in my heart that I reply to you, Nikolai Vladimir Rovich... demands that the emperor abdicates and the people want a new Russia.""

 Paris_Commune.1.d: "Arise, you hungry and cold slaves\nArise, you suffering people all over the world! \nMy blood is already boiling\nWe must fight for the truth!\nWhen the "Internationale" sounded over Paris, red flags were hung on street lamps and buildings across France. The dream of Eugène Baudier, the outstanding leader who participated in the Paris Commune 50 years ago, has been realized today.\nSince the Industrial Revolution, the polarization between rich and poor in French society has continued to intensify. In addition, Paris was besieged by the Prussian army, with constant artillery fire and food shortages. The poor became increasingly poorer, and the entire city fell into restlessness. The Prussian army continued to bombard Paris, and the living conditions of the people in the city worsened. All this has greatly intensified the dissatisfaction among all sectors of society. The citizens of Paris, especially the working class and lower middle class, wanted a democratic republic. In January 1871, someone put up a huge red poster that read "Make way for the Commune. The people of Paris have the right to protect themselves and create a better world." At the same time, a citizen armed force called the "French National Guard" also took up arms and led the entire working class. This self-defense force developed rapidly. It took only one month to form 194 battalions, with 300,000 people participating. It later became an important force in the Commune. After the establishment of the Paris Commune, it began to construct its own ideal society. They issued a "Message to the French People" and put forward their own governing program, emphasizing that "citizens continue to participate in commune affairs, express their opinions freely, and safeguard their own rights and interests", transforming from "making decisions for the people" to "making decisions by the people" .

Who is it, I'm a rebel who makes a living by stealing. Additionally, I burned down several mansions to defend my freedom from those in power. I have confessed to you my life of struggle. Before I get your understanding, let me tell you one last thing. If you accuse me primarily of being a thief, then it makes sense to define what theft is. In my opinion, theft is a desire that all humans feel to satisfy their appetite. This desire is present in everything: from the stars, which are born and die like life, to the bugs in space, so small and so numerous that our eyes can hardly distinguish them. Life is about stealing and killing. Plants and animals eat each other to survive, so everyone is ingesting and stealing nutrients. Are we going to charge him with a crime? of course not! So why do we distinguish these from the others? Because everything else requires effort, a certain amount of labor. And labor is the essence of society; that is, the union of all individuals seeking great happiness with small efforts. If you want to remove the effect, you must first remove the cause. The baker who bakes bread cannot eat any crumbs, the shoemaker who makes shoes and mends his shoes has his toes exposed, the tailor who weaves and sews clothes does not cover his body, and the huts of the masons who build high-rise buildings, castles and palaces are broken by the autumn wind. … Those who produce everything have nothing, and those who produce nothing have everything. If there is theft, it is only because one side has more than enough and the other has less: only because everything belongs to only a few. The struggle will not end until people share their joys and sorrows, their labors and wealth, when everything belongs to everyone.\n\n As a revolutionary anarchist, I practice my revolution.

When the new revolutionary regime took over the crumbling ruins, looking back, I was shocked to find that the superficial prosperity of the old empire seemed to have disappeared with the collapse of the empire. Not to mention the prosperous markets of the past, even the most basic crops and industrial products were in the center of Paris. , tax revenue all showed a cliff-like decline. The reason is obvious. The French Democratic Federation has no overseas colonies and is jointly blockaded by most of Europe. The loose federal system makes it impossible for it to implement central control. Even Alsace, the most important local source of iron ore raw materials, is Lost, except for the trade from the New World that provided timely help, the French economy has in fact been paralyzed. The result is bound to be disastrous. Even the most fanatical French people who praise the revolution can only sadly conclude: "Spain's situation was almost thirty years ago" when faced with this situation. In the ongoing pain, a deformed economic structure with almost stagnant natural growth was rebuilt, but fate played another cruel joke at this time. After taking the lead in blocking France for nearly 30 years, the damn British came here. At that time, they came to the door again with a "cooperative" face. They wanted to moisten the British sword with the blood of the French. They succeeded. Coastal areas were opened up one after another regardless of their wishes. Industrial products from old industrial areas could not compete in the dangerous international market. Workers were forced to lay off and move abroad. Farmers were almost driven out of their own land. Hometown, move to town. But even if the gangsters talk about these "economic leaps" they have achieved, they cannot face the shrinking market demand and declining strategic value after the League of Nations and the Continental Entente. Today, as expected, the secondary industry, the backbone of the French Democratic Federation, has continued to decline over the years, but the rights of the proletariat have been intensified... It is as if the economic history of this regime is a history of disaster."
 FRW.18.a: "Nothing dries up faster than tears."
  
 FRW.19.t: "our government"
 FRW.19.d: "According to the Declaration of Democratic Founding in 1875, the nature of the French Democratic Federation is the so-called "Left-wing Parliamentary Federal Republic", although this is already much better than the earlier "Confederation", and many people praise it as the second revolution of the Paris Commune. , but things are changing internally... In the north, in the industrial urban area centered on Paris, the huge population base and the need to organize industrial production prompted the Paris center to build a rough grassroots organization, and soon it lived up to expectations. Rust and rot: Although the "French Federation of Trade Unions" born in Limoges in 1895 represents the trade unionists and even anarcho-syndicalists, facing this situation, the central government shouts "trade union autonomy" and "workers rule the factory" Necessity and once won the support of many seats in Parliament... It was not until the establishment of diplomatic relations between Britain and France at the beginning of the 20th century that the wind changed direction and a real systemic disaster broke out. The Federation was almost and impossible to be prepared to integrate with the international market. Bloodthirsty foreign capital While forcing the old industrial areas to weaken, they also blatantly invaded the anarchic autonomous regions. Systemic corruption and incompetence as well as the contradictions between the states, the north and the south, and the contradictions between the coast and the interior were fully exposed in the past two decades."
 FRW.19.a: "A little adds up, step by step."
  
 FRW.20.t: "embarrassed diplomacy"
 FRW.20.d: "Unlike the French Revolution in 1789, the Paris Commune had far less control over France than the National Salvation Committee. At the same time, the Paris Commune did not face pressure from all of Europe in the manner of the French Revolutionary War. Moreover, the Paris Commune of 1871 was far from representative of the whole of France. It was more of the first shot of the internal collapse of Napoleon's empire and its symbolic significance for later generations. The "Foundation Conference" held in Paris in June 1873 was even more chaotic and controversial than the National Assembly on the eve of the last French Revolution: we can never expect left-wing, right-wing, anarchy, republic, Bonaparte Ba, I don’t even know where Bourbon came from to participate in the grand event and rely on meetings to solve problems. It was not until August that a consensus on a "confederal republic" was established by a slim margin. As the constitution was revised and passed one by one, monarchy supporters had no choice but to retreat. This so-called "confederacy" is of course absurd, and nationalists Weeping that "this is dismembering the French nation," the left-wing totalitarian republicans represented by the Blanquists in the Paris Center began to squeeze out the few privileges of the center in an attempt to promote the reunification of France. The subsequent history is simple. The counter-revolutionary counterattack broke out two years later and was extinguished with the release of the Central Government's compromise "Declaration of Democratic Founding." In the end, all the poisonous snakes hiding in the dark were eliminated, until the military government in 1877 After the dissolution, today's "French Democratic Federation" officially entered the stage of history, and France's domestic political differences gradually became moderate... until the "War of Robbery" broke out in 1908, a war of unprecedented scale that spread to former colonies and colonies in Asia, Africa and the United States. When the war started, the French Democratic Federation was pushed onto the international stage in an awkward position. Its foreign strategy needed to make choices in the face of pressure from Britain and Austria. Internally, the Central Council was troubled by the strong rise of pro-British liberals. This led directly to the establishment of a pan-left big tent government, a pacifist approach, and the government of Jean Jaures, but we all know that beneath the surface peace were deeper and deeper rifts."

Jaurès once praised the revolutionary thoughts inspired by the French Revolution more than once. Through a spasmodic and painful effort, the French Revolution was straightforward and Bold and violent methods were used to target the power of the king. During this period, France experienced an epic transformation: the past aristocratic and religious privileges were constantly under attack from liberal political organizations and people protesting in the streets. Old ideas gradually gradually It was replaced by new democratic ideas such as natural human rights and separation of powers, thus becoming a revolution in the true sense. It was also the Great Revolution that freed the French people from thousands of years of royal oppression and exploitation. Jaurès mentioned that the current Federation is also in the continuation of the French Revolution."

 FRW.27.a: "smart move"
 FRW.28.t: "Cubism"
 FRW.28.d: "Young artists are generally concerned with how to innovate forms to express people's inner emotions and psychology in the rapidly changing industrial society. Following Fauvism, Post-Impressionism, and Symbolism, Cubism emerged to lead a new era. Cubist painters used dull monochrome to simplify objects and decompose them into the same plane to form semi-abstract compositions with different shapes. Objects intertwined on the same plane. The painter does not directly depict the object, but suggests it through geometric figures, and the viewer needs to reconstruct the object itself through his or her own understanding and observation. Here, abstraction is not the ultimate goal of Cubism, but a means. Braque firmly believed that decomposition was “a technique that brings us closer to the essence of an object.”"
 FRW.28.a: "Can anyone tell me what this is?"
 FRW.29.t: "A chaotic parliament"
 FRW.29.d: "The noisy quarrels of the parliament echoed in Jaurès's ears, "Enough!" as Jaurés slapped the case. The parliament fell into a brief silence. Jaurès continued: "50 years ago, we were united. The socialist movement began to spread around the world from France. This movement is now in full swing in countries around the world and is happening everywhere at the same time. Ten years later, if you don't When writing the history of the Socialist Party, one cannot write about the history of Italy, Germany and Austria. The same is true for the United States and Australia, and even the United Kingdom, which you think is the stronghold of capitalism. The British Trades Union Congress has joined the socialist movement and they are no longer limited to On their own island, they united to join the socialist movement and sent representatives to various international congresses. On the other hand, as the only and first country with a socialist system in the world, we instead argued endlessly over trivial matters. Should we be ashamed of forming cliques to fight against MPs who have different political views? That's all. We feel it is necessary to conduct a social experiment, and practice will give us true knowledge.""
 FRW.29.a: "Why can't we all unite?"
 FRW.30.t: "caucus"
 FRW.30.d: "Jaures arrived in Brussels in the afternoon. Batavia Prime Minister Troelstra personally greeted Jaures's entourage at the station. At the meeting, Jaures expressed his views on the current European situation. He believed that the current situation Europe is still in a peaceful stage, but there are also militants. We must prevent conflicts from expanding into wars and involving workers across Europe in the flames of war. To prevent this from happening is the duty of workers all over the world, not just a national or international matter."

 FRW.31.d: "Just after the meeting, Jaurès walked out of the conference hall slowly and was about to get in the car. Suddenly, there was a dull gunshot from the right side of the motorcade. The bullet hit the car door and hit the side of Jaurès. Fortunately, Jaurès Les was not seriously injured, but the murderer has not been found so far. Only a hood and a Browning M1900 pistol were found at the scene."
 FRW.31.a: "The dream of peace was almost strangled in the cradle"
 FRW.32.t: "Herway Thoughts"
 FRW.32.d: "Hervey said in a 1905 speech: "Our propaganda is carried out simultaneously on both sides of the national border. What it brings is not the German army coming to invade or dismember your country, but the simultaneous opposition of the French and German proletariat. their exploiters." In addition, in order to better guarantee peace, Hervey also advocated that the proletariat of all European countries should unite to "establish a free European federation, which is the prelude to the great federation of mankind, into which today's countries will be incorporated Among them, just as the ancient provinces were incorporated into what we now know as France, England and Germany." In order to emphasize his radical anti-militarism strategy, Herway asked the proletariat to engage in "anti-patriotism" and ignore Motherland, nation and other things. He borrowed the phrase "the proletarians have no motherland" in the "Communist Manifesto" to advocate that "the motherland is the motherland of the ruling class and has nothing to do with the proletarians." He believes that the motherland and the nation are bourgeois things, and the proletariat does not need to pay attention to these things, because "capitalist exploitation, no matter what national brand it carries, is no different to the proletariat.""

We call on all parties to remain rational and refrain from doing things that would excite tensions or exaggerate the crisis."
 FRW.34.a: "Peace is hard won"
  
  
 FRW.35.t: "1921 general election"
 FRW.35.d: "As a European power and the "leader" of socialism, the political direction of the French Democratic Federation has attracted the attention of the world. Regardless of who wins, the war crisis, soaring inflation and the country's positioning will all be thorny issues facing the new president.\nCurrently there is a Possibilist faction led by Georges Clemenceau participating in the election. The younger generation places its hope on the Social Liberal Party, hoping to get rid of the bad luck of unstable temporary work and possible unemployment, and believes that it will create a "freedom of the repressed". a dynamic, creative and entrepreneurial nation” that breaks free from restrictive practices and the shackles of over-regulation, over-taxation, and ultimately a vengeance on Germany.\nAnother strong competitor for the Social Liberal Party is the leader of the Socialist Party, Leon Blum. As Jaures's most proud disciple, Léon Blum spared no effort to spread the word of Jaures. However, when it came to violent revolution, Leon Bloom believed that "violent revolution" ran counter to the spirit of democracy, so he was regarded as an alien by radicals within the party.\nMarcel Garcin was one of the members of the Standing Executive Committee of the merged French Socialist Party. The Blanquists he led resolutely opposed the imperialist war. Marcel Garcin vigorously praised Lenin's thought and insisted on exposing the bourgeoisie. He resolutely safeguarded the interests of the working class and the working people and actively carried out revolutionary propaganda. "It is a model of using bourgeois parliaments to engage in revolutionary propaganda." At the same time, we hope to use revolutionary violence to smash the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.\nThe Guesdes were formed by the old revolutionary Jules Guesde. By the 1990s, Guesde's health was in poor condition, so Jean Longuet inherited Guesde's mantle. The Guesdes actively promoted the theory of scientific socialism. The Guedists consider themselves international socialists. The Guedists believe that it is everyone's duty to defend the motherland in war. They should follow the example of the Jacobins and members of the Paris Commune during the great revolution of the late 18th century to defend the motherland from aggression. You can even take the initiative to attack the enemy when necessary."

 HAQ.8.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan the person"
 HAQ.8.d: "Chen Tiaoyuan was the garrison envoy of Xuhai. The Lincheng carjacking case occurred in Shandong. He was not involved in the incident at first. However, due to the incompetence of Tian Zhongyu and others, the matter was delayed for a long time. In addition, he is used to dealing with bandits and understands their psychology very well. After he arrived in Zaozhuang, he talked with Sun Guizhi, Zhou Tianlun and other bandit leaders, and immediately gained their favor. When Chen arrived at the mountain, Sun Meiyao waited to see that he had a peaceful attitude, laughed out loud at every word, and drank when there was wine and ate when there was food, without any restraints. It was like he was at the home of an old friend, so everyone was very affectionate towards him. In the afternoon of that day, Wen Shizhen and Anderson were asked to send all the foreign tickets and six Chinese tickets out of the mountain first. This started a deadlock that lasted for more than a month. Uncles and nephews Sun Guizhi and Sun Meiyao let Chen Tiaoyuan and more than a dozen people into a temporary banquet tent to host a banquet. In fact, they kept it as collateral. Chen Tiaoyuan toasted and drank at the banquet without any doubts. When he saw that Sun Meiyao's eyes were a little red and swollen, he asked if he was sick. Sun Meiyao said that it was because he had been busy on the mountain these days and stayed up a few nights. Chen Tiaoyuan immediately took out a pair of black glasses from his arms and gave them to him. He patted his shoulders and said, "Bring them on, it will be better. Brother! You are the leader of a village, so you should take extra care!" "No one has cared about Sun Meiyao like this since he was born. Of course he is regarded as a good person. Chen Tiaoyuan himself had two guards, and Wu Changyuan, a brigade commander of the Tanaka Yu faction, also had a guard, both with box cannons. Before going to bed that night, the resourceful old bandit leader Sun Guizhi suddenly said to Chen Tiaoyuan with a smile on his face: "Guardian, you should arrange it earlier. We will send sentries everywhere at night, and nothing will happen... On the contrary, if you lead It's best for the brothers who came here not to go out, to avoid misunderstandings..." After he stopped speaking, Chen Tiaoyuan felt clear in his heart, and immediately ordered the guards: "Unload the guy and give it to the old boss, that's right."\n\n The next day, Sun Meiyao accompanied Chen Tiaoyuan down the mountain and signed a peace treaty with Zheng Shiqi. On the same day, Chen Tiaoyuan accompanied Sun back to the mountain for an inspection. The inspection results showed that the total number of bandits was only 3,000, and less than 100 of them had guns. 1,200 people, men, women, old and young, among the bandits, were all given death certificates. Those who were unwilling to join the army were allowed to disarm and be sent home, and their personal belongings were allowed to go home."

Seven people carrying Wincher got off the train. The Man with the Shotgun and the Revolver All seven were detectives from the private detective agency Baldwin Fields. The Baldwin Fields Detective Agency made its fortune by doing business with the mine owners, and the detectives were like the mine owners' private policemen, following their orders. The main task of these thugs is to torture and threaten miners who want to join the union, and attack those who want to organize workers. Fields sent these people to Mingo County because the coal mining company was at odds with the United Mine Workers, the most powerful union in the United States, and conflict was about to break out. Baldwin Fields detectives were assigned to evict families of fired workers from the mine owner's house. Upon arrival in Matewan, detectives immediately began the eviction. They hoped for a quick victory and hoped to catch the 5:15 pm train back to Bluefield, a city in southwestern West Virginia. Soon after they started, they were surrounded by a group of townspeople. The group was led by Matewan Mayor Cabell Tistmann and Sheriff Sid Hatfield, both of whom were supporters of the union. Detectives claimed that the eviction was authorized by a judge and was a legal act, but they could not produce the authorization letter. "Then, you can't do anything here, and we'll let you go this time," Mayor Tistmann said. That evening, the detectives arrived at the station and prepared to take the train back. Waiting for them at the station was Mayor Tistemann and a group of police officers who were quickly summoned.

Over the next week, union members began to gather throughout West Virginia, eventually gathering in Mamet, a small town outside Charleston. Some even wore Civil War-era military uniforms, while others simply wore overalls with blue aprons. However, almost everyone wore a red scarf around their neck, which soon became a characteristic of the rebels. Among their own people, they openly talked about how to march into Mingo County and how to free the union members imprisoned in the prison. The Sheriff of Logan County, Don Keffen, was a powerful obstacle to the miners. As the right-hand man of the mine owners, he firmly swore that "no armed thug can pass through Logan County." In order to fulfill this oath, Kefen summoned many mercenaries and received a response from the local militia. But Kefen's preparations were not enough to dispel the governor's anxiety, and he turned to Washington for assistance. President Woodrow Wilson dispatched federal troops, and the commander of the federal troops, General Bondholtz, had a very clear purpose: to get the miners home. In Washington, the military will never fight unprepared, and Ohio's infantry task force is ready to go.

Each local miners' union has established its own squad. Usually the local leader is also the battlefield commander. After hastily completing the defense fortifications in Logan County, Kefen was prepared for a rebel attack. Men from all over the country augmented Kefen's armed forces. The Miner Army's attack plan was a classic pincer strategy. The northern arm attempted to flank the Blair Mountains, while the southern arm advanced westward over the mountains. If all goes well, they will meet up in Logan County and dance on Don Kefen's grave. But the miners soon learned one of the oldest rules of war: the enemy firmly holds the commanding heights and is at a disadvantage in mountainous battles. Kefen's army was stationed on the twin peaks of Blair Mountain. The well-equipped army blocked the miners on the gentle slope leading between the twin peaks. About 50 miners on the southern flank charged directly, trying to cross the ridge studded with machine guns. Kaifen's defenders used machine guns to drive back the miners, and the powerful firepower injured five miners. Furthermore, Kefen did not limit his protection to the ground offensive. He sent specially equipped biplanes loaded with tear gas and bombs, but all the bombs fired at the miners missed their targets. As time passed, there was no breakthrough in the government's offensive. The miners realized that Bondholtz's patience had reached the breaking point and that federal troops could arrive at any time. They gathered their last strength to try to break through the defense line leading to Logan County."
