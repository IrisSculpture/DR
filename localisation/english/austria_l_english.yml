 AUS_0: "the future of empire"
 AUS_0_desc: "Although Austria appears to be the hegemon of Central Europe and the leader of Germany, it also faces severe challenges. Prussia intends to compete for the leadership of Germany, while Hungary seeks independence. We need to find a balance between handling German affairs and easing internal national conflicts. If we are not careful, Austria will be in ruins."
 AUS_ger_1: "Give up Germany"
 AUS_ger_1_desc: "We cannot maintain our influence in Germany when the problems within the empire are so acute. We have to withdraw from the fight for German hegemony, but we will not give it to the Prussians in vain. Diplomatic envoys will go to Berlin for consultations. In exchange for some form of benefit: help training our troops, mutual defense of France, and most importantly, Prussia would give us some form of diplomatic support on the Hungarian issue."
 AUS_ger_2: "Maintain the German Confederation"
 AUS_ger_2_desc: "We are unable to take the initiative in the struggle for German hegemony, but we will not give up our sphere of influence. Although it would be impractical to initiate a war against Prussia, we would attack Prussia on another front—diplomacy. Our excellent diplomats will travel among the German courts, and if all the states are on our side, Prussia has nothing to fear."
 AUS_ger_3: "embark on unification"
 AUS_ger_3_desc: "The Prussians are trying to challenge our hegemony in Germany. They believe that it is their destiny to unify Germany, and we will prove them wrong with actions. Germany must be unified and can only be unified by Austria!"
 AUS_ger_4: "Win support from other states"
 AUS_ger_4_desc: "Nominally, we are still the chairman of the German Confederation, and Austria still enjoys prestige among the German states as the country that led Germany to defeat France. We need to further deepen our ties with the German states to force them to side with us in the coming conflict."
 AUS_ger_5: "Befriend Prussia"
 AUS_ger_5_desc: "Austria and Prussia are natural allies - both geographically and nationally. Although we have differences over the leadership of the Confederacy, we still have to face the French threat with them. A détente with Prussia would be beneficial to both of us."
 AUS_ger_6: "OP Secret Appointment"
 AUS_ger_6_desc: "The diplomatic envoys to Berlin brought back a reply from Wilhelm II - they had agreed to a preliminary agreement, but further negotiations were still needed. But in any case, a civil war among the Germans was avoided."
 AUS_ger_7: "prepare for war"
 AUS_ger_7_desc: "We will prepare for a war that will shatter Prussia's illusions about German hegemony once and for all. But in terms of military tradition, Austria has never been as good as Prussia. We need to be prepared for this war of brothers."
 AUS_ger_9: "Ties with South Germany"
 AUS_ger_9_desc: "The Catholics of South Germany were obviously closer to us than the Protestants of Prussia. Regardless of religious or cultural considerations, they will prefer that we unify Germany, and South Germany will be our natural ally."
 AUS_ger_8: "Control the Rhineland"
 AUS_ger_8_desc: "The liberal ethos in the Rhineland was incompatible with the Prussians. They would not want a militaristic Prussia to unify Germany, and we could bring them to our side with a little diplomatic influence."
 AUS_ger_10: "Support Hannover"
 AUS_ger_10_desc: "Hanover is the largest state in North Germany after Prussia. We will arm Hanover so that it can compete with Prussia in North Germany."
 AUS_ger_11: "Concede on Saxony"
 AUS_ger_11_desc: "Prussia has coveted Saxony for a long time. When Napoleon was defeated, Prussia had the intention to annex Saxony, but we stopped it. Prussia is now planning a rebellion in Saxony. In order to reach an agreement with Prussia on the division of spheres of influence, we might as well hand over Saxony to Prussia."
 AUS_ger_12: "Focus on the common enemy"
 AUS_ger_12_desc: "The French are always looking forward to retaking Alsace-Lorraine. Compared with Prussia, France is our biggest enemy - whether in terms of ideology or national hatred. We still need cooperation with Prussia against France."
 AUS_ger_13: "Delimitation of German sphere of influence"
 AUS_ger_13_desc: "We and Prussia are both exhausted in Germany, and it is time to reach a compromise with Prussia. We will reach an agreement with Prussia on the division of German power, and both sides will no longer destroy the other's sphere of influence. Of course, Prussia might reject us."
 AUS_ger_14: "Two Germanys Plan"
 AUS_ger_14_desc: "German nationalists still seek the unification of Germany, but now it seems that a unified Germany is unrealistic. The next best thing is that our and Prussian spheres of influence will become the South German Confederation and the North German Confederation respectively."
 AUS_ger_15: "hoard ammo"
 AUS_ger_15_desc: "Logistics is an important part of war, and in preparation for war with Prussia we will prepare our logistics now. We can dump this ammunition on the Prussians at the right time."
 AUS_ger_16: "Introducing the Prussian training system"
 AUS_ger_16_desc: "Prussia's army is famous all over the world. Although it was once defeated by Napoleon, Prussia washed away its humiliation in the German-French War. The agreement with Prussia was that Prussia would help us professionalize our military."
 AUS_ger_17: "seek diplomatic support"
 AUS_ger_17_desc: "Hungary had seceded from the empire and it was now time for Prussia to fulfill its promise. Prussia will side with us to suppress the rebellious Hungarians."
 AUS_ger_18: "Austro-Prussian Alliance"
 AUS_ger_18_desc: "Austria and Prussia will formally conclude an alliance with close military, economic, and political ties. Prussia and Austria would work together to face any future threats."
 AUS_ger_19: "Preparing for the Silesian Offensive"
 AUS_ger_19_desc: "We lost Silesia in 1748, but we will regain it in the next war. The Army would prepare a plan to quickly capture Silesia at the start of the war to destroy Prussia's industrial capabilities."
 AUS_ger_20: "empire reborn"
 AUS_ger_20_desc: "Austria soundly defeated enemies who attempted to challenge her German hegemony, consolidating her control over Germany in the process. A unified German country has finally reappeared on the land of Central Europe, and the world will eventually surrender to Austria!"
 AUS_ger_21: "Isolate Prussia"
 AUS_ger_21_desc: "Not all German states are willing to sacrifice their independence to achieve a unified Germany... By exaggerating Prussia's expansionist threat, we can win over some states."
 AUS_ger_22: "Establish leadership of the German Confederation"
 AUS_ger_22_desc: "All the German states were on our side, and the leadership of the Confederation was firmly in the hands of Austria. Prussia can no longer challenge our German hegemony."
 AUS_bir_0: "Bosnian crisis"
 AUS_bir_0_desc: "With the removal of the Governor and the transfer of Bosnia to Illyria, Hungary submitted to us a serious protest. They told us that Illyria was separated from Transleitania and have always been resentful. They claimed that Bosnia and even all of Illyria should belong to them, even at the risk of independence."
 AUS_bir_1: "Support Illyria"
 AUS_bir_1_desc: "We gave the Magyars enough preferential treatment, but what they got in return was their exaggeration. This time we will not condone them, we will stand on the side of Illyria."
 AUS_bir_2: "Stay out of it"
 AUS_bir_3: "Aid to Illyria"
 AUS_bir_3_desc: "The size difference between Illyria and Hungary is huge, and if we want Illyria to survive Hungary's attack, we must give aid."

 AUS_bir_4_desc: "A corps of Austrian officers will arrive in Illyria to serve as military advisors to guide Illyria."
 AUS_bir_5: "support arms"
 AUS_bir_5_desc: "We will transport some of the equipment from the arsenal to Illyria to arm them."
 AUS_bir_6: ""Volunteer Army""
 AUS_bir_6_desc: "It is difficult to imagine that Illyria alone can withstand Hungary... We will send several infantry divisions to Illyria in the name of volunteers to fight."
 AUS_bir_7: "Back to Hungary"
 AUS_bir_8: "last ditch diplomatic effort"
 AUS_bir_9: "Suppression of the Slavs"
 AUS_bir_10: "Rebuilding Austro-Hungarian ties"
 AUS_bir_11: "dual empire"
 AUS_bir_12: "Instigating the independence of the Transletanian minority"
 AUS_bir_12_desc: "Hungary became an independent empire. The Magyars thought they had gained freedom, but other peoples did not necessarily. Transletania's oppression of ethnic minorities is even worse than ours. We can promise the ethnic minorities a certain degree of autonomy to cause chaos in their country."
 AUS_bir_13: "Transactions with other crown territories"
 AUS_bir_13_desc: "The other Crown Territories are less enthusiastic about suppressing Hungary... but we can tempt them to join the war by promising them territory formerly under Translaetania's jurisdiction after the war."
 AUS_bir_14: "Suppress Hungary"
 AUS_bir_14_desc: "Now is the time to destroy the Hungarian rebels by force! The crown of St. Stephen will return to the Habsburgs!"
 AUS_bir_15: "Split Transleitania"
 AUS_bir_15_desc: "Hungary has returned to our hands, and we will split her up according to the predetermined plan to ensure that she no longer poses a threat to us."
 austria.1.t: "State of the Empire"
 austria.1.d: "In 1871, the Austrian Empire led the angry Central European Allied Forces to crush the Napoleonic Empire at its peak, and the German nation united under the Confederation led by the Austrian Emperor.\nSome people say that this is the reappearance of the Holy Roman Empire and the rise of a new empire, but in fact it is more like the sunset. \nIn 1900, the decadent and progressive Communist Federation attracted the Slavs, Egyptians and even Dixie, and marched towards the world until the land under the sun. The war between the Continental Entente and the British Empire and the League of Nations ended in a small victory, and the Empire reached its peak.\nBut the new 20th century is not a good era for Austria. The road ahead is downhill. France, its neighbor to the west, is always ready to avenge Alsace-Lorraine, Prussia within the German Confederation intends to declare the unification of the German nation, and even the Hungarians, the sharp blade of the empire, are fighting for independence, damn nationalism.\nThe princes and nobles who are used to living a stable life will only seek human skin and blood in the palace... But at least, now, Austria is still the most powerful empire in the world."

 austria.3.a: "So be it."
 austria.4.t: "Austria wants to carve out spheres of influence in Germany"
 austria.4.d: "The Austrian side hopes that we can reach a certain consensus with them on the ownership of Germany. The Austrians came up with a draft. They will put most of the northern German area under our sphere of influence, and the southern German area under Austria. The Rhineland will maintain the status quo."

Under the witness of all German members, the "Vienna Concordat" was officially signed that day."

 austria.6.t: "Treaty of Vienna"
 austria.6.d: "Although we are very reluctant to leave, we must cut our flesh, serve a feast in Vienna to entertain the "guests", and declare that the Confederation is ultimately the original alliance of Germany and Austria.

 austria.6.a: "The Black Hawk finally docked at Wenport in the Holy Empire"
 austria.7.t: "German-Austrian League"
 austria.7.d: "Recently, at the Congress of Vienna held in the capital of the Austrian Empire, a world-changing Treaty of Vienna concluded an alliance between two brotherly countries. Bismarck was not necessarily right. What was not achieved with iron and blood was achieved through negotiation and cooperation.\nIn short, this is not good news. European countries are once again shrouded under the dark cloud of Germany. Hell, they didn't even drop a single body for the infighting."
 austria.7.a: "Pax Deutschland does not mean world peace"

 austria.10.t: "Next step"
 austria.10.d: "Germany has fallen under our control, but the situation within the Reich remains complicated. Although some states have temporarily submitted to our rule, they still have great local autonomy. And the German nationalists, dissatisfied with our non-German territories, wanted us to become a fully Germanized country."

 AUS_reform_1: "Reorganize the Imperial Army"
 AUS_reform_1_desc: "The armies of the various old states did not change much after the reunification. Our generals cannot directly command the Prussian or Bavarian armies. They still obey the command of their own staffs. The equipment of the armies of each country is still in its own way. We will unify the military equipment of the imperial army and reorganize the command system of each old country into one."
